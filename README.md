# dotfiles
This is my set of dotfiles. The most vim settings are taken from the dotfiles repository of Andrew Burgess. I have custom settings for vim, vsvim (Visual Studio VIM), bash, git, and sublime. Feel free to use these files but be aware that some files may contain personal information like my email address or custom tool settings.
